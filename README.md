# peopleMaker

Basically, this is my first python project on GitHub.

#What it does: 
  - Creates a .txt file from other files with info
    -first name
    -last name
    -color
    -job title
#Why?
In the past, when plating Watch_Dogs and Watch_Dogs 2, I often found myself how the population was generated.
In those games, you have access to people's private info by just pointing your cursor at them.
I wanted to try to (badly) emulate what that kind of automation looks like.
That is, by taking in a bunch of random info and combining it to make a person with (almost) unique info and in very little time.
