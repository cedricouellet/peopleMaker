# Random Person Generator

Basically, this is my first python project on GitHub.

## What it does: 
  Creates a .txt file from other files with info
  - first name
  - last name
  - color
  - job title
## Why?
  Idk, mostly cause the way Watch_Dogs 1, 2 & Legion generate people 
    is cool and i wanted to learn a bit about randomization using files in Python 3.
